Membership

To become a member of The Imaginary Historians Society a character must
submit a masters thesis which meets the following criteria:

* At least 2000 words
* Scholarly in tone and affect
* Contributing new knowledge to the field of history
* Is not plagiarized or copied from any source
* Is not written with the aid of any generative artificial intelligence
* Well researched (with citations)

Submitted theses will be reviewed by an admissions committee of three
member characters. Each committee member shall submit an evaluation
which will be one of three possibilities:

* ACCEPT
* REJECT
* REQUEST REVISION

If all three members of the committee ACCEPT the thesis, the character
is a member of the Imaginary Historians Society, and granted all the
rights and privileges thereof.

If any one of the committee members REJECT a thesis, the thesis is not
accepted and the character must submit another one.

If one or more committee members REQUEST REVISION of a thesis, supplying
suggestions for revising, the character may revise and resubmit. A revised
thesis will then be evaluated by each committee member with either
ACCEPT AFTER REVISION or REJECT.
