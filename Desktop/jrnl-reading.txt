[2021-05-26 01:15] For God and Country.
pp. 381-474

Finally finished this awful book. I'm not sure what I expected from it. I guess I expected it to be better in general. I didn't want it to be great--it was just that it was so ostentatiously bad. Completely out of touch with itself, and the world. If it was a campy action story, it could have done with a simple plot. If it was something more, it could do that.

Instead, For God and Country is too many things all piled on top of one another. None of them make sense. It's frustrating that it sort of pretends that they build up to something. Oh well. At least I have a signed copy. Maybe it'll be worht something in a hundred years.

[2021-05-27 12:54] Just a thought I should keep.
Funny that that kid from Carrier also made that video I saw about the Vietnam vet. It's a funny small world. Granted that they were both fed to me by **the algorithm** and the militrary youtube scene is probably smallish, it's still weird how connections like that pop up.

It's weird to think of there being a person behind all of this media. And, when it comes down to it, not that many people.

[2021-05-28 07:30] Does the suicide hotline actually work?
@questions

In my head here are the criteria for it working:

1) Number of people who would have committed suicide had they not called the hotline (1 is enough)
2)?
