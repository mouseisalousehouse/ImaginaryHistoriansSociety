IT is said by  the wise and the poor alike that the  first city of man
was  J’raithra, since  many  of  the oldest  stories  come from  those
people, and even  the buildings seem to be the  most ancient which can
be found anywhere at all. J’raithra was a city even during the time of
King Drufuis, and this is testified in the Journey of Heroes where the
poet says of Oltuin “And even the sea beasts danced before him for his
pleasure,  and the  quiet men  of the  high-pointed isle  raised their
hands to  him whenever he passed  by, the very sun  and moon lingered,
when they hovered  above his golden helm.” when all  the world outside
of Oltuin’s house  was barbarity and savagery. The  tower at J’raithra
is said to be  the oldest tower by seven thousand  years of any other,
and  this certainly  cannot be  disputed, for  when one  looks at  the
stonework  and compares  it  even to  the oldest  masonry  in our  own
cities, it is far more worn and darkened by age.

EVEN the phrases  which the people of J’raithra use  in their everyday
speech is  as “I will  meet you by the  street” and “I  was clambering
upon the hill”, without recourse to naming the features of their city,
as though those  features to which they refer were  the first of their
kind, and so require no other name than “street”, “square”, or “hill”.

THE  prince Juoinigatt  was fathered  by  Juoin, who  was fathered  by
Nartook, who was fathered by Ablook, who was fathered by Untinell, who
was fathered by Juoin, who was  fathered by Huntiark, who was fathered
by Cablion. This is testified by  the relations we have had with those
of J’raithra  by way  of warfare, trade,  and marriage.  The Wanderers
first  encountered Cablion  after the  First Feast,  and there  he was
already a well-established monarch. The priests of J’raithra interpret
the sagas written upon the walls of the Tower at J’raithra to say that
Cablion is  descended from Rutoh,  and that  they are separated  by 75
generations of father and son.

RUTOH is said to have commanded to his son Exkaiel to collect from the
fields  and forests  those people  he could  find and  bring them  all
together at  one high  place, whereupon Exkaiel  assigned to  each the
labor  of woodsman,  soldier, gardener,  priest,  and so  on. In  some
stories According  to some  accounts Rutoh  has Exhaiel  construct the
Tower as a guide for the scattered  peoples to come to, though this is
unlikely, since  there could not  be such advanced stonework  in those
days  to  build  that  tower,  unless Exhail  be  given  some  special
dispensation by the gods, and there  is no mention in any account that
he ever was,  something which would surely be notable  and given in an
account.
