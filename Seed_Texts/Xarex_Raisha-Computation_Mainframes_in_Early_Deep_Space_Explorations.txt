: Computation Mainframes in Early Deep Space Explorations

--------------------------

* Abstract

At the outset of the Second Exploration, there were four mainframe
computer assemblies capable of processing Starship Navigation Data
Packets (SNDaPs) at the scale required for Dynamic Variable Hyperspace
calculations. These were: INIC, designed by Industrial Designs, Inc.,
Orion II, from Intex, and the AL-2900 and RL-320 Systems, from
Trepidatious Enterprises. 

Second Exploration program directors were mandated immense
responsibility and had to make difficult choices about personnel,
resource managament, and technological progress. This essay argues
early decisions about deep space computation during the Second
Exploration, particularly the choices made about memory systems and logic architectures, had a tremendous effect upon starship capabilities in the
middle and late phases of the period. Ultimately, these early
technological choices were contributing factors in the decline and
collapse of space exploration during the era.

By the middle of the Second Exploration, and thereafter, exploratory programs favored paper punch card memory systems over magnetic media. This method was more secure in the short term, as magnetic media could be susceptible to radiation and relativity effects of DVH travel. In the long term, however, the memory requirements for extended hyperspace travel corresponded to an increase of vessel size to accomodate card storage and processing facilities. The increased size of vessels meant greatly increased cost, which resulted in fewer exploratory vessels in operation.

Exploratory programs favored Lars-Krommen's Complete Logic Architecture[fn:3]  

* Historical Background

3204.3 is generally considered to be the start date of the Second
Exploration. King Ozz III of Naru-B issued a proclamation declaring exploration of outer space to be "The highest ideal of planetary patriotism.", and "

* Technical Background

Until the discovery of abstractspace by Ariel Moriarty in 5389[fn:1],
the only known reliable method of faster than light (FTL) travel was
to briefly pass into (or "skim") hyperspace with fusion
engines. Vessels would accelerate to near-light speeds (generally
between 0.8c and 0.85c) while advancing parallel to the plane of a
hyperspace fold. This allowed the vessel to rapidly oscillate into and out of 
hyperspace.[fn:2] Since hyperspace is wrapped around normal space (more precisely: since each point in hyperspace corresponds to at least two in normal space), the effect of this oscillation was to carry the ship "along" the hyperspace fold. 

This method of travel was cumbersome and costly. The vessels were large to accomodate the fusion engines, and were at the mercy of
hyperspace fold. The nearest hyperspace fold to Naru-B, home
of Ozz, is 3 light years away. During the entirety of the Second
Exploration, and well after, starships spent 4 years in deep space at
near-light before skimming hyperspace and completing their voyage.

Early forms of hyperspace skimming chose a vector along the
hyperspace fold, and rode it until the oscillations wavered out of proportion.  This came to
be known as static variable hyperspace travel, because the trajectory
of the vessel relative to the fold-plane remained locked to the plane
itself. These calculations could be computed by humans, and were
suitable for early forays into deep space, as well as generation-ship colonization efforts.[fn:4]  A drawback of this kind of travel was
unpredictability--the hyperspace fold often spit vessels back into normal space between
20 and 100 light years off course.[fn:5] While hyperspace folds are, definitionally, static phenomena, the skimming vector was often chosen using guesswork.

Dynamic Variable Hyperspace travel, invented in 297.04 by Rushmon Alton, allowed the vessel to adjust its
relative trajectory to match the fold-plane, thereby giving the
navigator far more control over how far the fold would take it.  The
calculations for this kind of travel are orders of magnitude more
complex, and require the processing of micro-second snapshot of stars. This complexity scaled with the mass of the vessel, since the vibrance of oscillations were attached to each point of the vessel along....

Computer mainframe assemblies were developed to make these
calculations. An array of radiotelescopes produced data about the relative location, and speed of the starship. SNDaPs were then fed into the mainframe assembly (electronically, mechanically, or, in extreme circumstances /manually/), and the
