Conquest of the Iilaans

by Aston

Note by Bartholemew Zax, Translator

Aston's classic work is a work of poetry, 45 cantos of rhyming Old Oron in iambic Hexameter. I have rendered here a translation in prose in order t….literal version possible. The reduction in poetic flourish (which is substantial) will I hope be offest by a more faithful conveyance of the symbolism and m....

Conquest of the Iilaans
-----------------------

ORONTES--the man with gilded step and cracked helm, who wore pelted boar and bracelets of silver wrought, ORONTES--wise counsellor beyond which no bloodthirst has exceeded, the man of rage and wile, of depth and scorn, ORONTES--unknowable mind and fierce as the day is bright, noble, Wanderer. Great Goddess of the birds, reveal to me the song of this noble man of men, show to me his faith and the granules of his grit. Preserve in me his living-force, his insipidity, his breadth.

Bright all-seeing Dawn leapt from house to house by rooftops bearing Her sister, Light.
Upon the head of Orontes Light danced and played, him gazing out upon the plain in wait of an urgent message.
...
Cablion Zuexarxes, corrupt and wicked despot of J'raithra, spake a curse upon Orontes. 

And J'raithra was rent from the earth, each stone unlimbered. 
And the tower of J'raithra was pulled from its height and scattered, and the priests of J'raithra were shattered upon the rocks. And the people of J'raithra were dispersed on the winds and into the soil. And Orontes lorded over the devastation.

The grin of Orontes glistened, and the men with him were in awe, and the attendants were amazed, and the men of the allies were struck with astonishment. Lips parted, his teeth shone pure white in supreme satisfaction.
"The doom of great peoples," Orontes boomed,  "is nothing less than over-flowering growth. We must flourish 
upon the surface of the earth like so many blooms.  As a gardener tills his soil, making sure each inch is 
watered and clear, but after tilling his soil, the gardener casts good seeds here and there, as many as he can,
 in a wild fashion. So we must now cast ourselves here and there."
...
The woman of the well lifter her head and spoke...
And Orontes lifted his head and drank from the cup.

Computation Mainframes in Early Deep Space Explorations

by Raisha Xarex

-------------------------------------------------------

Abstract

At the  outset of  the Second Exploration,  there were  four mainframe computer  assemblies capable  of processing  Starship Navigation  Data Packets (SNDaPs) at the scale  required for effective Dynamic Variable Hyperspace  calculations. These  were:  INIC,  designed by  Industrial Designs,  Inc., Orion  II,  from  Intex, and the  AL-2900 and  RL-320Systems, from Trepidatious Enterprises..... deep  space  computation during  the  Second Exploration, particularly  the dominance  of INIC compatible systems, had an  effect upon starship capabilities in the middle and late  phases  of the  period.  Ultimately,  these early  technological choices--especially  the  focus  on  paper  storage  and  Lars-Krommon logic--were contributing factors in the  decline and collapse of space ex…..
....favored  paper  punch  card  memory  systems  over  magnetic media. This method was more secure in the short term, as magnetic media could  be  susceptible to  radiation  and  relativity effects  of  DVH travel.  In  the  long  term, however,  the  memory  requirements  forextended hyperspace trave….vessel size to accommodate  card storage  and processing facilities.  The increased size  and personnel  requirements of  these vessels  greatly increased cost, which resulted in fewer exploratory vessels in operation.

* Historical Background

3204.3 is  generally considered  to be  the start  date of  the Second
Exploration. King  Ozz III of  Naru-B issued a  proclamation declaring
exploration  of outer  space to  be  "The highest  ideal of  planetary
patriotism.", and "The fulfillment of Orontic heritage."

Along  with   the  rhetorical   effects,  the   proclamation  directed
substantial planetary funds towards those explorations.

Following within 8 months of  this proclamation three expeditions were
mounted: the Righteous, with a crew of  86; the Oron II, with 109; and
the Triumphant, with 74. These initial expeditions in truth did not come to very much, but the enthusiam they were the beginnings or a second age of exploration.

The first age of exploration had ended two generations previously. It had come to an abrupt end with the outbreak of the Virus War. Once it was discovered that the singularity method was not a viable means of interstellar travel, combined with the exigencies of total war, national budgets were not keen on the vast expenses required for space travel.

But now the situation had changed. Ozz II succeeded in his goal of a unified planetary government, and for nearly 20 years the planet was operating under an uneasy peace. Here and there there were pockets of resistance to the Ozz-Oronitc regime, but the movements were largely isolated, and failed to reach the critical masses necessary for full scale revolt.

Ozz III was, however, constantly wary of these rumblings towards dissent. Additionally, Ozz has an ecological problem: water scarcity was growing in several regions due to a combination of droughts and agricultural mismanagement.

To reinvigorate a sense of unified patriotism, Ozz elected to pour money into the dormant space programs.

Over the next century and a half 259 interstellar explorations were launched, and more than twice this number were planned or seriously proposed. The Second Exploration contributed substantially to the expansion and settlement of humanity.

* Technical Background

Until the discovery of abstractspace  by Ariel Moriarty in 5389[fn:1],
the only known  reliable method of faster than light  (FTL) travel was
to   briefly   pass   into   (or  "skim")   hyperspace   with   fusion
engines.  Vessels would  accelerate  to  near-light speeds  (generally
between 0.8c  and 0.85c) while  advancing parallel  to the plane  of a
hyperspace fold. This allowed the vessel to rapidly oscillate into and
out  of hyperspace.[fn:2]  Since hyperspace  is wrapped  around normal
space (more precisely:  since each point in  hyperspace corresponds to
at least two  in normal space), the effect of  this oscillation was to
carry or propel the ship "along" the hyperspace fold.

This  method of  travel was  cumbersome and  costly. Vessels were necessarily large  to accomodate  fusion  engines, and  were at  the mercy  of
hyperspace fold. The  nearest hyperspace fold to Naru-B
is 3 light years away. During  the entirety of the Second Exploration,
and well  after, starships spent 4  years in deep space  at near-light
before skimming hyperspace and completing their voyage.

Early crude methods of hyperspace skimming involved chosing a vector along the hyperspace
fold, and  rode it until  the oscillations wavered out  of proportion.
This  is known  as Static  Variable Hyperspace  travel (SVH),
because  the  trajectory of  the  vessel  relative to  the  fold-plane
remained  locked to  the  plane itself.  These  calculations could  be
computed  by humans,  and were  suitable  for early  forays into  deep
space,  as  well  as  generation-ship  colonization  efforts.[fn:4]  A
drawback of  this kind of travel  was unpredictability--the hyperspace
fold often  "spit" vessels  back into  normal space  between 20  and 100
light   years   off   course.[fn:5]  While   hyperspace   folds   are,
definitionally, static phenomena, the skimming vector was often chosen
using guesswork.

Dynamic Variable Hyperspace travel, or  DVH, was invented in 297.04 by
Rushmon Alton, allowed the vessel to adjust its relative trajectory to
match the  striations of the obverse fold-plane, thereby  giving the navigator  far more
control over  how far the  fold would  take it.  The  calculations for
this kind of travel are orders  of magnitude more complex, and require
the  processing of  micro-second data about absolute position. Generally, this data was collected by taking and processing snapshots of visible stars. This  complexity
scaled with the mass of the vessel, since the vibrance of oscillations
were attached to each point of  the vessel along its cleavage with the
fold-plane.

Computer   mainframe  assemblies   were   developed   to  make   these
calculations.  An array  of  radiotelescopes produced  data about  the
absolute location,  and speed  of the starship.  SNDaPs were  then fed
into  the mainframe  assembly  (electronically,  mechanically, or,  in
extreme circumstances /manually/), and the mainframe output possible vector-

* Preamble

For   nearly  a   century  now   the  go-to   text  for   introductory
historiography  courses has  been  Dr.   Alastair Chrun's  _Historical
Method_  [fn:1].   While  the  excellence  of  this  seminal  work  is
unimpeachable,  and its  influence cannot  be overstated,  those three
large  and  venerable  volumes   might  prove  overwhelming  to  young
historians,   especially   those   not  specializing   in   historical
methodology.

Such  students are  often anxious  for instructions  on doing  history
rather  than  trudging through  theory, and this is hardly a blameworthy perspective.   Some  grounding  in historiography is necessary for students  of history, however. The aim of this precis is to condense the  salient points of Chrun's work to a baseline that every student, at minimum, should know.

History is the study of conditions  in the past. Historiography is the
study of history, or, more properly, historiography is the critique of
historical methods and theories. Dr. Chrun puts it consisely: "to the
historian, history is what was, method is what he does". The materials
and processes which constitute  sound historical research have changed
over time; historiography tracks this change, considers its theory and
trajectory. Study  of historiography  makes us better  historians, and
helps in reading the works of historians past.



* Ancient Histories
  
The earliest histories  might more properly be  called accounts rather
than histories.  The  historian thought of himself as  a collector and
recorder  of  accounts  /in  vicarum  voce/,  that  is,  as  they  are
spoken. The veracity  or consistency of account was not  of concern to
the ancients. (Aston's epic, /Conquest of the Iilaans/ should be regarded as fanciful interpretation rather than proto-history.) Haipolites,

Some theorists have  suggested that the apparent lack  of concern for
veracity  indicates  ancient  peoples  had  no  concept  of  objective
reality;  that  the  "event"   (a  material,  rememberable,  objective
occurence) is a modern invention. Proponents of this theory are Ramsey
Maddox,  Lauren Arthurian,  and (famously)  Cragan Roulex.[fn:2]In general
this theory should  be discounted.  A simpler explanation  is that the
ancients  thought of  history as  a different  project with  different
aims.   An account  is  a representation  of the  world;  the work  of
recorders, as vie ancients understood  it, was to convey for posterity
these representations

The idea of meddling with received accounts in service of a logically
consistent "event" would likely be anathema to the ancients. Such
historical work would be an overstepping on the part of the
historian. Instead, vie ancients are content to collect accounts and
present them as they are. There is a profound sense to this approach,
from a certain point of view.
 
* Narrative Histories

By the time of decline of the Oron empire, history as
account-collecting war becoming onerous. Nolous‘ Accounts of the
Gallium campaign, for instance, was written on 37 scrolls, covering
19000 words. This for a work covering g 2 month campaign. Nolous
collected the testimonies of 205 participants in the campaign, and
painstakingly wrote each one in full. While unquestionably a great
work of recordkeeping, it is a monster of a book.

The  accounts  are  exceedingly  repetitive, and  the  most  important
aspects of vie campaign (for  instance, vie innovation of maneuverable
blocks of spearmen) are obscured.

Arek  the   Wise  is  began   to  write  summarization   history:  vie
condensation  of  accounts  into  a  whole  narrative.  This  war  not
uncontriverrial  at  vie  time,  and  it  is  not  what  might  center

rolled into a Smitjap massivegtd,  Andrew vie historicalagm picked vie

Unknown Author

======================================================================

IT is said by  the wise and the poor alike that the  first city of man
was  J’raithra, since  many  of  the oldest  stories  come from  those
people, and even  the buildings seem to be the  most ancient which can
be found anywhere at all. J’raithra was a city even during the time of
King Drufuis, and this is testified in the Journey of Heroes where the
poet says of Oltuin “And even the sea beasts danced before him for his
pleasure,  and the  quiet men  of the  high-pointed isle  raised their
hands to  him whenever he passed  by, the very sun  and moon lingered,
when they hovered  above his golden helm.” when all  the world outside
of Oltuin’s house  was barbarity and savagery. The  tower at J’raithra
is said to be  the oldest tower by seven thousand  years of any other,
and  this certainly  cannot be  disputed, for  when one  looks at  the
stonework  and compares  it  even to  the oldest  masonry  in our  own
cities, it is far more worn and darkened by age.

EVEN the phrases  which the people of J’raithra use  in their everyday
speech is  as “I will  meet you by the  street” and “I  was clambering
upon the hill”, without recourse to naming the features of their city,
as though those  features to which they refer were  the first of their
kind, and so require no other name than “street”, “square”, or “hill”.

THE  prince Juoinigatt  was fathered  by  Juoin, who  was fathered  by
Nartook, who was fathered by Ablook, who was fathered by Untinell, who
was fathered by Juoin, who was  fathered by Huntiark, who was fathered
by Cablion. This is testified by  the relations we have had with those
of J’raithra  by way  of warfare, trade,  and marriage.  The Wanderers
first  encountered Cablion  after the  First Feast,  and there  he was
already a well-established monarch. The priests of J’raithra interpret
the sagas written upon the walls of the Tower at J’raithra to say that
Cablion is  descended from Rutoh,  and that  they are separated  by 75
generations of father and son.

RUTOH is said to have commanded to his son Exkaiel to collect from the
fields  and forests  those people  he could  find and  bring them  all
together at  one high  place, whereupon Exkaiel  assigned to  each the
labor  of woodsman,  soldier, gardener,  priest,  and so  on. In  some
stories According  to some  accounts Rutoh  has Exhaiel  construct the
Tower as a guide for the scattered  peoples to come to, though this is
unlikely, since  there could not  be such advanced stonework  in those
days  to  build  that  tower,  unless Exhail  be  given  some  special
dispensation by the gods, and there  is no mention in any account that
he ever was,  something which would surely be notable  and given in an
account.

Colonial Theology Extracts

by Elias Shook

============================

* Introduction

Conventional wisdom dictates that planetary colonies in between the First and Second Explorations were dominated by monotheology--that is, nearly every Colonial Directive and colonist subscribed to the Wisdom, or, if not, did not speak up about it. T…."colonial religion" are published every year to great popularity. Some of these books do not even pretend to name …. specific colonies whose theology they are supposedly describing. They treat all colonies as if they were one and the same project, and all religious practice as if they were one and the same ….. isinterest in religion, precipitated by an abrupt secularization of society, is to blame in part for this, I think. And yet, this is bad scholarship. The precepts of New Atheism may be all well and good for one's personal life and perhaps for the affairs of state, but I…. ill attempt, in some small part, to remedy this. I will describe seven theological positions from seven different colonies. These positions developed more or less independently, and sometimes contradict one another. I present them as a case study for the diversity of religious thought during this period, and…. revive serious interest. The compression of historical religious thought is as damaging, if not m….om and knowledge as the Great Inquisition was in its censorship of scientific progress.
"The Substance of GOD consists of immense Light penetrating all things. Without this Light there would be no life, and there woulrd be no dimension either, since space is nothing other than Light extended. Thus planets, being holes in space, shadows in Light, are interruptions of the cosmic fold. It is here were we live; the grand floridity of human experience is only a flickering shadow to the real Light of the cosmos."

When did it Happen? Marking Time in the Modern Era
