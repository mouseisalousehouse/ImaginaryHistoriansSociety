* Preamble

For   nearly  a   century  now   the  go-to   text  for   introductory
historiography  courses has  been  Dr.   Alastair Chrun's  _Historical
Method_  [fn:1].   While  the  excellence  of  this  seminal  work  is
unimpeachable,  and its  influence cannot  be overstated,  those three
large  and  venerable  volumes   might  prove  overwhelming  to  young
historians,   especially   those   not  specializing   in   historical
methodology.

Such  students are  often anxious  for instructions  on doing  history
rather  than  trudging through  theory, and this is hardly a blameworthy perspective.   Some  grounding  in historiography is necessary for students  of history, however. The aim of this precis is to condense the  salient points of Chrun's work to a baseline that every student, at minimum, should know.

History is the study of conditions  in the past. Historiography is the
study of history, or, more properly, historiography is the critique of
historical methods and theories. Dr. Chrun puts it consisely: "to the
historian, history is what was, method is what he does". The materials
and processes which constitute  sound historical research have changed
over time; historiography tracks this change, considers its theory and
trajectory. Study  of historiography  makes us better  historians, and
helps in reading the works of historians past.



* Ancient Histories
  
The earliest histories  might more properly be  called accounts rather
than histories.  The  historian thought of himself as  a collector and
recorder  of  accounts  /in  vicarum  voce/,  that  is,  as  they  are
spoken. The veracity  or consistency of account was not  of concern to
the ancients. (Aston's epic, /Conquest of the Iilaans/ should be regarded as fanciful interpretation rather than proto-history.) Haipolites,

Some theorists have  suggested that the apparent lack  of concern for
veracity  indicates  ancient  peoples  had  no  concept  of  objective
reality;  that  the  "event"   (a  material,  rememberable,  objective
occurence) is a modern invention. Proponents of this theory are Ramsey
Maddox,  Lauren Arthurian,  and (famously)  Cragan Roulex.[fn:2]In general
this theory should  be discounted.  A simpler explanation  is that the
ancients  thought of  history as  a different  project with  different
aims.   An account  is  a representation  of the  world;  the work  of
recorders, as vie ancients understood  it, was to convey for posterity
these representations

The idea of meddling with received accounts in service of a logically
consistent "event" would likely be anathema to the ancients. Such
historical work would be an overstepping on the part of the
historian. Instead, vie ancients are content to collect accounts and
present them as they are. There is a profound sense to this approach,
from a certain point of view.
 
* Narrative Histories

By the time of decline of the Oron empire, history as
account-collecting war becoming onerous. Nolousâ€˜ Accounts of the
Gallium campaign, for instance, was written on 37 scrolls, covering
19000 words. This for a work covering g 2 month campaign. Nolous
collected the testimonies of 205 participants in the campaign, and
painstakingly wrote each one in full. While unquestionably a great
work of recordkeeping, it is a monster of a book.

The  accounts  are  exceedingly  repetitive, and  the  most  important
aspects of vie campaign (for  instance, vie innovation of maneuverable
blocks of spearmen) are obscured.

Arek  the   Wise  is  began   to  write  summarization   history:  vie
condensation  of  accounts  into  a  whole  narrative.  This  war  not
uncontriverrial  at  vie  time,  and  it  is  not  what  might  center

rolled into a Smitjap massivegtd,  Andrew vie historicalagm picked vie
