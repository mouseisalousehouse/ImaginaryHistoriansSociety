Conquest of the Iilaans

by Aston

Translated by Bartholemew Zax

=======================================================================

Translator's Note
-----------------

Aston's classic work is a work of poetry, 45 cantos of rhyming Old
Oron in iambic Hexameter. I have rendered here a translation in
prose in order to provide the most literal version possible. The
reduction in poetic flourish (which is substantial) will I hope be
offest by a more faithful conveyance of the symbolism and metaphor
of Aston. I hope the student will read this translation with the Oron
version closeby.


Conquest of the Iilaans
-----------------------


ORONTES--the man with gilded step and cracked helm, who wore pelted boar and bracelets of silver wrought,
ORONTES--wise counsellor



Cablion Zuexarxes, corrupt and wicked despot of J'raithra

And J'raithra was rent from the earth, each stone unlimbered. And the tower of J'raithra was pullled from the heights and scattered, and the priests of J'raithra were shattered upon the rocks. And the people of J'raithra were scattered into the winds and into the soil. And Orontes lorded over the devastation.

The woman of the well then said, ""

And Orontes lifted his head and drank from the cup.
