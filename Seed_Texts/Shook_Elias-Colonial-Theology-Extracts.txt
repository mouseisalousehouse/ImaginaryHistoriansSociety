Colonial Theology Extracts

by Elias Shook

============================

* Introduction

Conventional wisdom dictates that planetary colonies in between the First and Second Explorations were dominated by monotheology--that is, nearly every Colonial Directive and colonist subscribed to the Wisdom, or, if not, did not speak up about it. The illocicality of this view is apparent on its face. The very idea that a large and diverse group of people, separated by millions of light years and hundreds of years, would spontaneously adhere to a single and identifiable religious ideology is, quite plainly, absurd.

And yet, despite this, books describing "colonial religion" are published every year to great popularity. Some of these books do not even pretend to name the specific colonies whose theology they are supposedly describing. They treat all colonies as if they were one and the same project, and all religious practice as if they were one and the same idea. The wider disinterest in religion, precipitated by an abrupt secularization of society, is to blame in part for this, I think. And yet, this is bad scholarship. The precepts of New Atheism may be all well and good for one's personal life and perhaps for the affairs of state, but it makes for bad history.

In this article I will attempt, in some small part, to remedy this. I will describe seven theological positions from seven different colonies. These positions developed more or less independently, and sometimes contradict one another. I present them as a case study for the diversity of religious thought during this period, and hope by presenting them to revive serious interest. The compression of historical religious thought is as damaging, if not moreso, to academic freedom and knowledge as the Great Inquisition was in its censorship of scientific progress.
