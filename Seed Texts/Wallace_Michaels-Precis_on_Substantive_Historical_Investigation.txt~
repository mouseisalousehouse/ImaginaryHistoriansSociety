Precis on Substantive Historical Investigation
-------------------------------------------------

by Michaels Wallace

=================================================

For nearly a century now the go-to text for introductory historiography courses has been Dr. Alastair Chrunâ€˜s Historical Method. While the excellence of this seminal work is unimpeachable, and its influence cannot be overstated, its three large volumes sometimes prove overwhelming to young historians, especially those not specializing in historical methodology. Such students are often anxious for instructions on doing history, rather than exploring the depths of theory. Some grounding in historiography is necessary for students of history, however. The aim of this precis is to condense the salient points of Chrun'ss work to a baseline that every student, at minimum, should know.

History is the study of conditions in the past. Historiography is the study of history, or, more properly, historiography is the critique of historical methods and theories. Dr. chrun puts it consisely: "to the historian, history is what was, method is what he does". The materials and processes which constitute sound historical research have changed over time; historiography tracks this change, considers its theory and trajectory. Study of historiography makes us better historians, and helps in reading vie works of historians past.
