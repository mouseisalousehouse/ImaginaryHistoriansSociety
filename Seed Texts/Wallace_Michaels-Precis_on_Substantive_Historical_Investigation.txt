Precis on Substantive Historical Investigation
----------------------------------------

======================================================================

	For  nearly a  century  now the  go-to  text for  introductory
historiography  courses has  been  Dr.   Alastair Chrun's  /Historical
Method/  [fn:1].   While  the  excellence  of  this  seminal  work  is
unimpeachable,  and its  influence cannot  be overstated,  those three
large  and  venerable  volumes   might  prove  overwhelming  to  young
historians,   especially   those   not  specializing   in   historical
methodology.

Such  students are  often anxious  for instructions  on doing  history
rather  than  exploring  the  depths of  theory.   Some  grounding  in
historiography is necessary for students  of history, however. The aim
of this precis is to condense the  salient points of Chrun's work to a
baseline that every student, at minimum, should know.


History is the study of conditions  in the past. Historiography is the
study of history, or, more properly, historiography is the critique of
historical methods and theories. Dr. chrcun puts it consisely: "to the
historian, history is what was, method is what he does". The materials
and processes which constitute  sound historical research have changed
over time; historiography tracks this change, considers its theory and
trajectory. Study  of historiography  makes us better  historians, and
helps in reading the works of historians past.
