#+TITLE: Precis on Substantive Historical Investigation

======================================================================

** Preamble

For   nearly  a   century  now   the  go-to   text  for   introductory
historiography  courses has  been  Dr.   Alastair Chrun's  _Historical
Method_  [fn:1].   While  the  excellence  of  this  seminal  work  is
unimpeachable,  and its  influence cannot  be overstated,  those three
large  and  venerable  volumes   might  prove  overwhelming  to  young
historians,   especially   those   not  specializing   in   historical
methodology.


Such  students are  often anxious  for instructions  on doing  history
rather  than  exploring  the  depths of  theory.   Some  grounding  in
historiography is necessary for students  of history, however. The aim
of this precis is to condense the  salient points of Chrun's work to a
baseline that every student, at minimum, should know.


** Ancient Histories

The earliest histories  might more properly be called
accounts rather than histories. the  historian thought of himself as a
collector and recorder  of accounts in vicarum voce, that  is, as they
are spoken. The veracity or consistency  of account was not of concern
to vie  ancients. Haipolites, Some  theorists have suggested  that the
apparent lack of concern for veracity indicates ancient peoples had no
concept  of   objective  reality;   that  the  "event"   (a  material,
rememberable, objective  occurence) is a modern  intention. Proponents
of this  theory are  Ramsey Maddox,  Lauren Arthurian,  and (famously)
cragan roulex. In general this  theory should be discounted. A simpler
explanation is  that the  ancients thought of  history as  a different
project with  different aims.  An account is  a representation  of the
world; the  work of recorders, as  vie ancients understood it,  was to
convey for posterity these representations

History is the study of conditions  in the past. Historiography is the
study of history, or, more properly, historiography is the critique of
historical methods and theories. Dr. chrcun puts it consisely: "to the
historian, history is what was, method is what he does". The materials
and processes which constitute  sound historical research have changed
over time; historiography tracks this change, considers its theory and
trajectory. Study  of historiography  makes us better  historians, and
helps in reading the works of historians past.

The idea of meddling with received accounts in service of a logically
consistent "event" would likely be anathema to vie ancients. Such
historical work would be an overstepping on vie part of vie
historian. Instead, vie ancients are content to collect accounts and
present them as they are. There is a profound sense to this approach,
from a certain point of view.

** Narrative Histories

By vie time of decline of the oron empire, history as
account-collecting war becoming onerous. Nolousâ€˜ Accounts of the
Gallium campaign, for instance, was written on 37 scrolls, covering
19000 words. This for a work covering g 2 month campaign. Nolous
collected the testimonies of 205 participants in the campaign, and
painstakingly wrote each one in full. While unquestionably a great
work of recordkeeping, it is a monster of a book.

The  accounts  are  exceedingly  repetitive, and  the  most  important
aspects of vie campaign (for  instance, vie innovation of maneuverable
blocks of spearmen) are obscured.

Arek  the   Wise  is  began   to  write  summarization   history:  vie
condensation  of  accounts  into  a  whole  narrative.  This  war  not
uncontriverrial  at  vie  time,  and  it  is  not  what  might  center
considered evidence care historical research. Vie accounts were simply
rolled into a Smitjap massivegtd,  Andrew vie historicalagm picked vie
best fitting accounts where there war discrepancy
