~~ Introduction ~~


"I found I could not by any sensible means escape that warren of funny
hats, petticoats, furs, collars, and knots."
-- Grand Duke Mothmetissis, after his visit with Ozz IV on Naru-B


     The Second Exploration was, of course, a frightfully dynamic
period for the Ozz Dynastic Sphere. In two and a half generations the
population had quintupled, the number of known interplanetary
societies had jumped from seven to fifty-nine, and interstellar
voyages had developed from dangerous, experimental affairs to a
routine, political ones.[1] For the members of the Ozz family itself,
the aristocratic clan which narrowly avoided being swallowed up by
ecological devastation and mass discontent suddenly found itself at
the heart of a flourishing imperial core. The granaries were
overflowing, forests were reclaiming man-made deserts, lakes were
refilling. More than these domestic miracles, goods and money were
flowing in from the stars: exotic flora and fauna, new technologies,
innovative financial products, literature, religiousity, and more.

     The courts of Naru-B near the end of the Second Exploration
were a perfect environment for striking styles. The courtiers under
Ozz IV and Ozz V developed elaborate and vibrant styles to demonstrate
their wealth, affirm the identity of Naru-B as distinct from the
explored territories, and to convey various modes of congeniality or
hostility. The distinct intentsity of Ozzian political dress affected
fashion in all societies they came in contact with. Even today the
Grontip hat is used to mark someone as stately or pompous, especially
in theatrical productions.

     Here, I will trace the development of three articles of clothing
which became central to the Ozzian Courtier costumery; the Grontip
hat, the Lazung, and the Brob sleeve. Although there are many other
components which convey a distinctively Ozzian style, these three
articles neatly demonstrate the diplomatic posturing as the dynasty
dealt with other interplanetary societies. I argue that, more than
decoration, clothing worn by diplomatic workers of the Ozzian Dynasty
were calculated, willful efforts to effect national policy.

~~ The Grontip Hat ~~

"Split lengthwise perpendicular to the seam, and gradually bring the
two halves together as though you are peeling an orange. The Gron
should remain close to the interior, so as not to be caught up in the
motion."
-- Manual for Practical Sewing, 5th Edition.

For many years it was believed that the Grontip hat has its origins in
the peasant-caps of the Old Oron empire. Michaels Wallace, for
instance, contends that "...these very hats were the staple of rugged
of-the-earth living, common throughout the lands and a sign of hearty
good nature."[2] Wallace attributed the "Caps," described in Alston's
epic as costume for Orontes' men: "And the men lifted their caps one
by one and sang out in clear voices."[3] When the Grontip hat was
featured on the Naru-B flag during the New Games, this heritage was
likewise referenced. During its dedication, President Roughty
proclaimed "This hat belongs to us all, it is our ancient
heritage."[4] The painting /Venture/ by Mothumiax Dort shows Emperor
Northgam III wearing a hat which looks strikingly like it bears a
Gron.

Recent archaeological evidence has called these ancient origins into
question. One study of ancient clothing found that no hats were found
with a protrusion resembling a Gron before the period of the First
Exploration.[5] This is not definite proof--after all, very few hats
have survived to the present period. In any case, no depictions have
been found of headwear with the distinctive Grontip perpendicular seam
before the Middle period. And here there are lots of examples.[6]
Thus, the Grontip hat as we know it today did undergo documented
structural changes. It is a murky claim that the hats worn in the Old
Oron Empire were /the same/ in any sense to the modern Grontip.

Current scholarship does suggest that something definitely resembling
the Grontip was beginning to be worn as a hunting hat among the petty
aristocracy in the late First Exploration and early Middle Period. The
Gron was quite stiff and squat, and it has been speculated that it was
used as a sort of handle or knob to quickly remove the hat in moments
of excitement.[7]
