~~ Introduction ~~


"I found I could not by any sensible means escape that crazy warren of
funny hats, petticoats, furs, collars, and knots."
-- Grand Duke Mothmetissis, after his visit with Ozz IV on Naru-B


     The Second Exploration was, of course, a frightfully dynamic
period for the Ozz Dynastic Sphere. In two and a half generations the
population had quintupled, the number of known interplanetary
societies had jumped from seven to fifty-nine, and interstellar
voyages had developed from dangerous, experimental affairs to routine,
political ones.[1] For the members of the Ozz family itself, the
aristocratic clan which narrowly avoided being swallowed up by
ecological devastation and mass discontent suddenly found itself at
the heart of a flourishing imperial core. The granaries were
overflowing, forests were reclaiming man-made deserts, lakes were
refilling. More than these domestic miracles, goods and money were
flowing in from the stars: exotic flora and fauna, new technologies,
innovative financial products, literature, religiousity, and more.

     The courts of Naru-B near the end of the Second Exploration
were a perfect environment for striking styles. The courtiers under
Ozz IV and Ozz V developed elaborate and vibrant styles to demonstrate
their wealth, affirm the identity of Naru-B as distinct from the
explored territories, and to convey various modes of congeniality or
hostility. The distinct intentsity of Ozzian political dress affected
fashion in all societies they came in contact with. Even today the
Grontip hat is used to mark someone as stately or pompous, especially
in theatrical productions.

     Here, I will trace the development of three articles of clothing
which became central to the Ozzian Courtier costumery; the Grontip
hat, the Lazung, and the Brob sleeve. Although there are many other
components which convey a distinctively Ozzian style, these three
articles neatly demonstrate the diplomatic posturing as the dynasty
dealt with other interplanetary societies. I argue that, more than
decoration, clothing worn by diplomatic workers of the Ozzian Dynasty
were calculated, willful efforts to effect national policy.

~~ The Grontip Hat ~~

"Split lengthwise perpendicular to the seam, and gradually bring the
two halves together as though you are peeling an orange. The Gron
should remain close to the interior, so as not to be caught up in the
motion."
-- Manual for Practical Sewing, 5th Edition.

For many years it was believed that the Grontip hat has its origins in
the peasant-caps of the Old Oron empire. Michaels Wallace, for
instance, contends that "...these very hats were the staple of rugged
of-the-earth living, common throughout the lands and a sign of hearty
good nature."[2] Wallace attributed the "Caps," described in Alston's
epic as costume for Orontes' men: "And the men lifted their caps one
by one and sang out in clear voices."[3] When the Grontip hat was
featured on the Naru-B flag during the New Oron Games, this heritage was
likewise referenced. During its dedication, President Roughty
proclaimed "This hat belongs to us all, it is our ancient
heritage."[4] The painting /Venture/ by Mothumiax Dort depicts Emperor
Northgam III after the Orons sacked Reio, wearing a hat which looks strikingly like it bears a Gron.

Recent archaeological evidence has called these ancient origins into
question. One study of ancient clothing found that no hats were found
with a protrusion resembling a Gron before the period of the First
Exploration.[5] This is not definite proof--after all, very few hats
have survived to the present period. In any case, no depictions have
been found of headwear with the distinctive Grontip perpendicular seam
before the Middle period. And here there are lots of examples.[6]
Thus, the Grontip hat as we know it today did undergo documented
structural changes. It is a murky claim that the hats worn in the Old
Oron Empire were /the same/ in any sense to the modern Grontip.

Current scholarship does suggest that something definitely resembling
the Grontip was beginning to be worn as a hunting hat among the petty
aristocracy in the late First Exploration and early Middle Period. The
Gron was quite stiff and squat, almost knob-like.[7]

Gradually the Grontip began to climb the ladder of aristocracy, first with hunting, then becoming a general "outdoors cap". At the beginning of the Second Exploration the Grontip made its first appearances in formal occasions, probably initially in out-of-doors events, and then it made its way indoors.

The earthen colors used in hunting gave way to deep greens and blues, and then further into warm pastels. Likewise, from stiff leather to canvas to silk. The Gron lengthened, allowing it to flop to one side or another. Early hunting Grontips show the Gron on the left side only, with few exceptions; towards the end of the Middle Period it seems to have diversified in location.

When the Ozzian diplomatic core found itself having to conduct elaborate social events with other societies, the Grontip was an immediate choice to demonstrate the Ozzian individuality. "And they stood rigid on the deck, arrayed in medals and stars, each one with a Grontip smartly worn, their eyes at attention to their commanders word."[8]

Ozz IV was the first king to have his portrait done wearing a Grontip, although many paintings of Ozz III depict him in one. There is one painting depicting Ozz II in what might be a Grontip, but it was painted well into the Second Exploration, and so may be anachronistic.

By the end of the Second Exploration, the Grontip had become diplomatic uniform. Endless variations of the hat were adapted and regulated. Wearing the Grontip outside of military bases on non-Ozz planets was prohibited. Indeed, for the diplomatic and military leaders, the Grontip could only be worn on Ozzian soil. It could not be worn in the consulates of other nations. Grontips signified that you were in Ozzian space.

Grontips were generally not used in starship voyages for these reasons. Being exploratory in nature made such an event precarious.

When the Second Exploration collapsed under its own weight, the Grontip ceased its diplomatic function and became relegated solely to domestic court function. The Gron became thinner and thinner, and eventually split into two or three strands, which may be the origin of formal tassels today (This has been disputed).

~~ The Lazung ~~

"Wound tightly around itself like a dying snake, the Lazung perfectly represents the stubborn ineptitude of the Naru-B military caste."
-- Colonel

[7] It has been speculated that it was used as a sort of handle to
quickly remove the hat in moments of excitement, although I am very
skeptical of this notion. It does not seem proper to me to assign
utility to articles of clothing which already bear a primarily
ceremonial use. I am not saying that these hunting Grontips could not
be used that way, but I am not ready to jump to a utility
interpretation of the Gron here, especially since no contemporary
sources appear to support that speculation.
