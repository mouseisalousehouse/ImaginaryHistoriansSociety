"I found I could not by any sensible means escape that warren of funny hats, petticoats, furs, collars, and knots."
-- Grand Duke Mothmetissis, after his visit with Ozz IV on Naru-B


The Second Exploration was, of course, a frightfully dynamic period for the Ozz Dynastic Sphere. In two and a half generations the population had quintupled, the number of known interplanetary societies had jumped from seven to fifty-nine, and interstellar colonization had metamorphosed from a dangerous, experimental affair to a routine, political one.[1] For the members of the Ozz family itself, the aristocratic clan which narrowly avoided being swallowed up by ecological devastation and mass discontent suddenly found itself at the heart of a flourishing imperial core. The granaries were overflowing, forests were reclaiming man-made deserts, lakes were refilling. More than these domestic miracles, goods and money were flowing in from the stars: exotic flora and fauna, new technologies, innovative financial products, literature, religiousity, and more.

The courts of Naru-B near the end of the Second Exploration were a perfect environment for striking styles. The courtiers under Ozz IV and Ozz V developed elaborate and vibrant styles to demonstrate their wealth, affirm the identity of Naru-B as distinct from the explored territories, and to convey various modes of congeniality or hostility. The distinct intentsity of Ozzian political dress affected fashion in all societies they came in contact with. Even today the Grontip hat is used to mark someone as stately or pompous, especially in theatrical productions.

Here, I will trace the development of three articles of clothing which became central to the Ozzian Courtier costumery; the Grontip hat, the Lazung, and the Brob sleeve. Although there are many other components which convey a distinctively Ozzian style, these three articles neatly demonstrate the diplomatic posturing as the dynasty dealt with other interplanetary societies. I argue that, more than decoration, clothing worn by diplomatic workers of the Ozzian Dynasty were calculated, willful efforts to effect national policy.
