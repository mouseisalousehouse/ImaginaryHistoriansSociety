Despite the temptation to run an entire website in character, I think it might be a good idea to have at least one coherent description of what this project is, what its aims and principles are, and how to engage with it.

The Imaginary Historians Society could be described as a creative writing roleplaying project. Each participant (I heasitate to use the term "player") assumes the role of one or more scholars. The main activity of scholars (and participants) is writing papers about history. The characters write the papers, do research, publish, cite and are cited by others. The life of a character-historian is known through their work, and also through little bits and pieces; semester class lists, departmental emails, etc.

The history is imagined--it's a science fiction history, contributed to by character-historians. I heasitate to consider this a /worldbuilding/ project. To me, worldbuilding implies work towards some objective whole, some finished product of canon. Worldbuilding is the development of content, content in which interesting stories can be told.
What interests me in this project is not so much the content of history, but rather the form.

In The Imaginary Historians Society there is no canon. There is no objectively understood event that we, as participants, /know/ happened. What we have instead are only essays. Opinions written by character-historians, which might be contradicted. We hope that our character-historians write the best history with the evidence and methods they have, but we have no assurance of this. The Imaginary Historians Society is all secondary sources.

I don't expect there to be a large amount of canonical shift throughout The Imaginary Historians Society--after all, we can expect scholars to be more or less diligent and fairly conservative--but I do think it's important that there be some degree of forgetfulness. The canon of the imaginary history is only held together through the strength of contemporary analysis and synthesis.

I don't plan on implementing any kind of enforced loss on the essays and articles here, but I do hope that we will be able to engage with the growing corpus with the skeptical minds of character-historians attempting to make a name for themselves.
