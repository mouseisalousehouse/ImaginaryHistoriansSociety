* Bylaws

The text of these bylaws can be amended with majority consent among characters  who have participated in the Imaginary Historians Society within the past month.

* Membership

To become a member of The Imaginary Historians Society a character must
submit a CV and a masters thesis which meets the following criteria:

- At least 1000 words
- Scholarly in tone and affect
- Well researched
- Contributing new knowledge to the field of history
- Not plagiarized or copied from any source
- Not written with the aid of generative artificial intelligence
- Not previously submitted to The Imaginary Historians Society

Submitted theses will be reviewed by an admissions committee of three.
Each committee member shall make an evaluation
which will be one of three possibilities:

- ACCEPT
- REJECT
- REQUEST REVISION

If all three members of the committee ACCEPT the thesis, the character
is a member of the Imaginary Historians Society as a PhD Student, and
granted all the rights and privileges thereof.

If any one of the committee members REJECT a thesis, the thesis is not
accepted and the character must submit another one.

If one or more committee members REQUEST REVISION of a thesis, supplying
suggestions and notes, the character may revise and resubmit. The revised
thesis will then be evaluated by each committee member with either
ACCEPT AFTER REVISION or REJECT.
