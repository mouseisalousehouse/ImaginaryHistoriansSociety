Conquest of the Iilaans

by Aston

Translated by Bartholemew Zax

=======================================================================

Translator's Note
-----------------

Aston's classic work is a work of poetry, 45 cantos of rhyming Old
Oron in iambic Hexameter. I have rendered here a translation in
prose in order to provide the most literal version possible. The
reduction in poetic flourish (which is substantial) will I hope be
offest by a more faithful conveyance of the symbolism and metaphor
of Aston. I hope the student will read this translation with the Old Oron
version closeby.


Conquest of the Iilaans
-----------------------


ORONTES--the man with gilded step and cracked helm, who wore pelted boar and bracelets of silver wrought,
ORONTES--wise counsellor beyond which no bloodthirst has exceeded, the man of rage and wile, of depth and scorn,
ORONTES--unknowable mind and fierce as the day is bright, noble, Wanderer.
Great Goddess of the birds, reveal to me the song of this noble man of men, show to me his faith and the granules of his grit. Preserve in me his living-force, his insipidity, his breadth.

Bright all-seeing Dawn leapt from house to house by rooftops bearing Her sister, Light.
Upon the head of Orontes Light danced and played, him gazing out upon the plain in wait of an urgent message.



Cablion Zuexarxes, corrupt and wicked despot of J'raithra, spake a curse upon Orontes. 

And J'raithra was rent from the earth, each stone unlimbered. And the tower of J'raithra was pulled from its height and scattered, and the priests of J'raithra were shattered upon the rocks. And the people of J'raithra were dispersed on the winds and into the soil. And Orontes lorded over the devastation.

The grin of Orontes glistened, and the men with him were in awe, and the attendants were amazed, and the men of the allies were struck with astonishment. Lips parted, his teeth shone pure white in supreme satisfaction.

"The doom of great peoples," Orontes boomed, "is nothing less than over-flowering growth. We must flourish upon the surface of the earth like so many blooms. As a gardener tills his soil, making sure each inch is watered and clear, but after tilling his soil, the gardener casts good seeds here and there, as many as he can, in a wild fashion. So we must now throw  ourselves here and there."

The men of Orontes shouted in 

The woman of the well then said, ""

And Orontes lifted his head and drank from the cup.
